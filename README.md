# XboxGameBarDesktopBypass
For those who want to use the Xbox Game Bar and record a selected part of the screen.

For working you need install Magnifixer (script tested vith ver. 10.2)
https://www.fileeagle.com/pl/software/2685/Magnifixer/

When you install the program, you need to change the path to it in the script (PathToMagnifixer)

F1-run script
F12-Panic button

Bugs:
-Sometimes XboxGameBar doesn't detect Magnifixer, so if this happens, try again by closing Magnifixer (press F4 or manually) and press F1
